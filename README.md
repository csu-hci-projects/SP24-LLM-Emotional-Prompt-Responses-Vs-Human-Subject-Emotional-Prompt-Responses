## Build and run
The application is built and run using Docker. To run the application,
cd into the `Source Code` directory and run the following command in the terminal:
``` docker compose up --build ```
The application client will be running on `localhost:3000`
You will need to add API keys for Google Gemini and OpenAI in the `.env` file in the `Source Code/server` directory to get responses from the AI models. These are included in the submitted zip for your convenience but not the github repository.
